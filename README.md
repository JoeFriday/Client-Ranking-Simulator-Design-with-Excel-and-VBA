# Project Purpose
I designed a simulative calculator with Excel for applicants who immigrate via the Express Entry system. Using this calculator reduced our consultation time and improved customer conversion.

# Background
Express Entry is an online system that IRCC uses to manage applications for permanent residence from skilled workers. The Express Entry System ranks candidates in the pool using a points-based system called the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS). IRCC will select the highest-ranking candidates from the pool and invite them to apply for permanent residence.

# Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) Criteria
This criteria includes four parts as following.
  A. Core / human capital factors
  B. Spouse or common-law partner factors
  C. Skill Transferability factors
  D. Additional points
 
The interface of the calculator is below.

There are sub-categories needed to fill under each factor and could calculate points based on different circumstences of each applicant.  
 
 # Points breakdown, section by section
Since the system is comprehensive scoring, applicants would get extra credits in the transferability factor if they fulfill specific conditions on first official language, education level, Canadian or foreign work experience. On 27 Oct.2020, IRCC updated the criteria that applicants with good French language skills will require extra points in the last factors. Besides, the marital status of the applicant would affect the score on the human capital factors. 

# Validation
Test the calculator to do the validation.

# Macro

To clear the contents automatically once the calculation is completed, I record a marco named clear to remove all the contents in each cell. And asign macro to a button called CLEAR ALL for the convinience of users.
